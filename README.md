# RedCap CryptO Locker for Api_keys (rccola)

This package is deprecated. Use `unlockREDCap` in `redcapAPI` instead. All necessary functionality for dealing with API_KEYs with REDCap has been moved there. 

This code is here for those who still need the package due to legacy reasons. It is not maintained. 

It will be removed from CRAN eventually.
